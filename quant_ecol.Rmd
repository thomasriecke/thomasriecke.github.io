I’ve often felt confused and overwhelmed by the complexity and intricacy of demographic models. However, I’ve tried to develop my skills as a quantitative ecologist in order to better understand and predict demographic rates of wildlife populations. I believe that an understanding of these processes is critical for successful applied ecology and conservation biology. Additionally, communicating these processes and model structures can be challenging, where many relatively simple ideas are hidden behind layers of formulas, likelihoods, computer code, and jargon. I seek to develop effective ways to communicate how these models work, and how we can use them to understand biological processes and benefit wildlife populations.
