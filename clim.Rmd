The work of Stephen C. Stearns (1989, 1992) has shaped the way I think 
about evolutionary ecology and population demography. The life-history strategies that 
organisms employ and the trade-offs that they experience ultimately shape population dynamics.
At the same time, we live in a rapidly changing world where anthropogenic actions have tremendous ecological consequences. 
In the short-term, inter- and intra-annual variation in temperature, 
precipitation, and extreme weather events have major effects on the success of 
life-history strategies. 
In the long-term, anthropogenic actions are changing global climates irrevocably. 
These changes have critical implications for life-history strategies that evolved over millennia.
Understanding the effects of climatic changes on life-history trade-offs is critically important for successful conservation ecology, particularly for specialist organisms with slow-paced life-history strategies.
