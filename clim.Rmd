We live in a rapidly changing world, where anthropogenic actions have tremendous ecological consequences. In the short-term we experience climatic cycling, where inter- and intra-annual variation in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events have major effects on population trends of wild organisms. In the long-term, anthropogenic actions are changing global climates irrevocably. Understanding the effects of these changes is critically important for successful conservation ecology, particularly for specialist orgamisms with slow-paced life-history strategies.
