My research focuses on using demographic data to better understand the complex relationships among environmental conditions, climate, anthropogenic actions, and population trends of wild organisms. I use models to quantify the contribution of different demographic components to population growth rates, and seek to work collaboratively across a range of ecological and evolutionary disciplines to answer important questions in the fields of applied ecology and conservation biology. I recently (2023) joined the faculty at the University of Montana, where I serve as the James K Ringelman Chair in Waterfowl Conservation. In that role, I primarily investigate the ecological drivers of North American waterfowl populations.  Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with exceptional people in wetlands and mountains from Alaska to the Swiss Alps, and I hope to continue my career working to benefit wildlife populations with inspiring people in beautiful places.
