My research focuses on using demographic data to better understand the complex relationships among environmental conditions, climate, anthropogenic actions, and population trends of wild organisms. I am currently a postdoc with Dr. Michael Schaub at the Swiss Ornithological Institute, where I investigate the demographic drivers of European passerine and North American waterbird populations.  Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with exceptional people in wetlands and mountains from Alaska to the Swiss Alps, and I hope to continue my career working to benefit wildlife populations with inspiring people in beautiful places.
