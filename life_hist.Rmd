The work of Stephen C. Stearns (1989, 1992) has driven the way I think about evolutionary ecology and population demography. I work collaboratively with others to use long-term datasets to examine life-history trade-offs, with a particular emphasis on understanding how individual heterogeneity moderates our understanding of these trade-offs in the context of changing environmental conditions. Ultimately, I hope to develop methods in a general life-history strategy framework to better understand and predict how organisms will respond to changes in habitat and climate.
