The capture-mark-reencounter, aerial survey, and harvest 
data collected on North American waterfowl populations
comprise one of the most comprehensive community population monitoring
efforts in human history. I use these and other longitudinal survey and demographic data 
to better understand landscape scale drivers of population trends. 
Together with a large number of collaborators, I develop novel analytical 
techniques and models that allow for incorporating uncertainty regarding 
processes that drive demographic parameters, and more accurately forecast 
population change given anthropogenic impacts such as harvest, 
land use, and climate change.
